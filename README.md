   ```

2. Change directory into the project:

### Running Locally

Simply open index.html in your browser.
Or if using a local server:

# Usage

Replace the placeholder product images in /images/ with your own product photos.

Update the text in index.html – product names, descriptions, links.

Modify style.css to change colours, fonts, layout to match your brand.

Optional: deploy using GitHub Pages by enabling Pages under your repository’s settings.

# Customisation

Some tips for customisation:

Change the primary colour theme by editing the :root variables in style.css.

Add or remove product cards in index.html using the existing HTML structure.

Ensure images have reasonable file sizes to keep page load fast.

Use alt-text for images for better accessibility and SEO.

If hosting affiliate links, consider adding UTM parameters or tracking tags.
